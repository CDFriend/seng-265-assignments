# SENG 265 Assignments
This repository contains the 3 major assignments I completed during in Software Development Methods at the University of Victoria (SENG-265).  I completed the course in Fall 2015.

The course focused on large-scale software development in C++ and Python - particularly requirements and test-driven development.
