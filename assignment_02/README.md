# Assignment 2
Python implementation of a library for parsing xml marks data with libxml2.  Code should get student data from an input xml file, calculate a mark and print the data to stdout.  Test scripts and requirements spec are provided by the instructor.

## File Patterns
* `marks_library.py` - Marks library implementation.
* `marks.py` - Script utilizing marks_library to process student data.
* `test_*.py` - Alternative test scripts for marks_library.
* `test_demo.txt` - output of marks.py script with implementation in `marks_library.py`
* `test_*.txt` - output of test scripts with implementation in `marks_library.py`
* `test_*_gold.txt` - output of test scripts with instructor's marks_library implementation.
* `*.xml` - input xml data.
